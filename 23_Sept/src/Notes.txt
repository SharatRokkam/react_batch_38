Context API : In React context api is a way to manage the global state and make the data accessible throughout the component.

It is a way to avoid props drilling technique and ensure that data is received in the desired component..

PropDrilling :

App.jsx --> Comp A --> Comp B --> Comp C(data)

Context API : 
1. Provider 2. Consumer 3. Context(Store)
